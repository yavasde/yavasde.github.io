I am a PhD candidate in computational linguistics at Heinrich-Heine University (HHU) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Laura Kallmeyer and Dr. Rainer Osswald. At the same time, I work as a doctoral researcher at the DFG-funded project “Coercion and Copredication as Flexible Frame Composition”.

My research focuses on the data-driven investigation of inherent polysemy and coercion. I work with Large Language Models and explore and exploit their ability to deal with meaning flexibility in language.
